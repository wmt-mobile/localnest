## What it includes

- canonical `localnest_*` tool names
- lexical, semantic, and hybrid retrieval
- opt-in local memory tools plus high-level task-context and capture-outcome workflow
- bundled install skill command
- version-aware skill sync behavior
- setup-time memory consent and config migration
- `localnest` top-level CLI command path (`setup`, `doctor`, `upgrade`)

## What changed in `0.0.4-beta.6`

- Hardened MCP response contracts and release verification so installed-runtime sweeps assert meaningful evidence instead of just process success.
- Improved retrieval miss handling, read-file path errors, update metadata, and runtime cache diagnostics for end users and MCP clients.
- Reworked the internal project layout into clearer `app`, `runtime`, `mcp`, `services`, and grouped `scripts` surfaces without changing user-facing commands.
- Added a `localnest_health` MCP tool and richer server status output for faster troubleshooting.
- Continued to prefer top-level `localnest` command usage for setup, doctor, and upgrade flows.
