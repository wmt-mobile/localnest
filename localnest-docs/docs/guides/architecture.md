# LocalNest MCP — Architecture

---

## What it is

A TypeScript MCP server that gives AI clients safe, read-focused access to your local codebase and agent memory with a full knowledge graph. Everything runs in-process over stdio — no HTTP, no cloud, no external service.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["AI Client"] -->|JSON-RPC over stdio| B["localnest-mcp"]
    B --> C["Your Files"]
    B --> D["Index DB"]
    B --> E["Memory DB"]
    B --> F["Knowledge Graph"]
    B --> G["Agent Diary"]
```

---

## How it boots

1. Read config from env vars and `localnest.config.json`
2. Build services (workspace, search, index, memory, updates)
3. Run forward-only schema migrations (v1 → v9)
4. Initialize hooks system (`MemoryHooks` instance on the store)
5. Register 72 MCP tools across 8 groups
6. Start background monitors (staleness sweep + health checks)
7. Open stdio transport → ready

---

## Tool groups

| Group | What it does | Key tools |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Core** | Server status, health, self-update | `localnest_health`, `localnest_server_status` |
| **Retrieval** | Find and read files, search code | `localnest_search_hybrid`, `localnest_search_code`, `localnest_read_file` |
| **Memory Store** | Store and query durable agent knowledge | `localnest_memory_store`, `localnest_memory_recall` |
| **Memory Workflow** | High-level capture and recall for task context | `localnest_capture_outcome`, `localnest_task_context` |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Entities, triples, temporal queries | `localnest_kg_add_entity`, `localnest_kg_add_triple`, `localnest_kg_query`, `localnest_kg_as_of`, `localnest_kg_timeline`, `localnest_kg_stats` |
| **Graph Traversal** | Multi-hop traversal, cross-nest bridges | `localnest_graph_traverse`, `localnest_graph_bridges` |
| **Taxonomy** | Nest/branch hierarchy browsing | `localnest_nest_list`, `localnest_nest_branches`, `localnest_nest_tree` |
| **Agent Diary** | Per-agent isolated scratch notes | `localnest_diary_write`, `localnest_diary_read` |
| **Ingestion** | Conversation import pipelines | `localnest_ingest_markdown`, `localnest_ingest_json` |
| **Dedup** | Semantic duplicate detection | `localnest_memory_check_duplicate` |
| **Hooks** | Hook introspection | `localnest_hooks_stats`, `localnest_hooks_list_events` |

---

## Workspace & project detection

You configure one or more root directories. LocalNest scans each root and auto-promotes any directory containing a known marker file (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.) into a named project. Tool calls can then be scoped to a single project via `project_path`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Config["Config / env var"] --> Root["Root directory"]
    Root -->|"scan for marker files"| Projects["Projects"]
    Projects -->|"scope with project_path"| Tools["Tool calls"]
```

---

## How search works

Hybrid search runs two signals in parallel and merges them.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Query --> Lexical["Lexical search"]
    Query --> Semantic["Semantic search"]
    Lexical --> Merge["RRF merge"]
    Semantic --> Merge
    Merge --> Results["Ranked results"]
```

- **Lexical** — fast exact matches, powered by ripgrep (TS fallback if missing)
- **Semantic** — local vector similarity via `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim, no GPU needed)
- **RRF** — Reciprocal Rank Fusion: combines both ranked lists into one score
- **Reranker** — optional cross-encoder pass for higher precision (off by default)

---

## How files get indexed

Files are split into overlapping chunks before they're stored and embedded.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    File --> Chunks["Chunks"]
    Chunks --> Terms["Term frequencies"]
    Chunks --> Embedding["Vector embedding"]
    Terms --> IndexDB["Index DB"]
    Embedding --> IndexDB
```

Default chunk size is 60 lines with 15 lines of overlap. The chunker uses AST-aware splitting for supported languages, falling back to line-based for everything else.

---

## Index backend

| Backend | When used | Storage |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `sqlite-vec` | Default (Node 22+) | Single `.db` file — BM25 + vector search |
| `json` | Fallback if sqlite-vec unavailable | Flat JSON index file |

Both backends expose the same tool surface. Switch via `LOCALNEST_INDEX_BACKEND`.

---

## How memory works

Events are scored on signal strength before being promoted to durable memory.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Event["capture_event()"] --> Score["Signal score"]
    Score -->|"above threshold"| Dedup["Dedup check"]
    Score -->|"below threshold"| Ignore["Discarded after 30d"]
    Dedup -->|"unique"| Promote["Durable entry"]
    Dedup -->|"duplicate"| Skip["Skipped"]
    Promote --> KG["KG entity extraction"]
    Promote --> Recall["recall()"]
```

Signal score is based on event type, completion status, files changed, and content quality. Thresholds range from 2.25 (preferences/decisions) to 3.0 (general tasks).

Entries flow through several connected subsystems: **dedup** checks for semantic duplicates before storing, **taxonomy** organizes entries by nest/branch, **agent scoping** isolates per-agent data, and the **knowledge graph** extracts entities and triples from stored content.

---

## Knowledge Graph subsystem

The knowledge graph (KG) is a first-class subsystem built on two tables — `kg_entities` and `kg_triples` — managed by `knowledge-graph/kg.ts` and `knowledge-graph/graph.ts`.

### Entity-Triple model (`knowledge-graph/kg.ts`)

Entities are named nodes with a slugified ID, a type (`concept`, `file`, `url`, etc.), an optional JSON properties bag, and an optional link back to a `memory_entries` row via `memory_id`.

Triples are directed edges: `(subject_id, predicate, object_id)` with optional temporal bounds (`valid_from`, `valid_to`), a confidence score (0-1), and provenance fields (`source_memory_id`, `source_type`).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S["Entity: auth_service"] -->|uses| O["Entity: jwt"]
    S -->|depends_on| D["Entity: token_refresh"]
    O -->|mentioned_by| R["Entity: assistant"]
```

Key operations:

| Function | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `addEntity()` | Insert-or-ignore an entity, update `updated_at` on collision |
| `ensureEntity()` | Same as addEntity but minimal — used internally by `addTriple` |
| `addTriple()` | Insert a triple in a transaction; auto-creates missing entities from names; detects contradictions (same subject + predicate, different object, still valid) and returns them as warnings |
| `invalidateTriple()` | Sets `valid_to` on a triple without deleting it — supports temporal queries |
| `queryEntityRelationships()` | Outgoing, incoming, or both triples for an entity |
| `queryTriplesAsOf()` | Point-in-time query: returns only triples valid at a given date |
| `getEntityTimeline()` | Full chronological history of all triples (including invalidated) |
| `getKgStats()` | Aggregate counts: entities, total triples, active triples, breakdown by predicate |

### Graph traversal (`knowledge-graph/graph.ts`)

Deep traversal uses SQLite recursive CTEs with cycle prevention (path-based substring check).

| Function | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `traverseGraph()` | Walk the KG from a starting entity up to N hops (1-5, default 2). Direction: outgoing, incoming, or both. Returns each discovered entity with depth and full path. |
| `discoverBridges()` | Find triples where the subject and object belong to different nests. Joins through `memory_entries` to compare nest values. Useful for surfacing cross-domain connections. |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["start entity"] --> H1["hop 1 neighbors"]
    H1 --> H2["hop 2 neighbors"]
    H2 --> H3["hop 3 (if maxHops >= 3)"]
    style Start fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

### Relationship to legacy relations

The older `memory_relations` table (`knowledge-graph/relations.ts`) still exists for simple bidirectional links between memory entries. The KG subsystem is the successor — it adds entity typing, predicates, temporal validity, confidence, provenance, and multi-hop traversal.

---

## Nest/Branch taxonomy

Memory entries are organized into a two-level hierarchy managed by `taxonomy/taxonomy.ts`:

- **Nest** — top-level domain or workspace (e.g. `project-alpha`, `devops`)
- **Branch** — sub-topic within a nest (e.g. `auth`, `ci-pipeline`)

Both are plain text columns on `memory_entries`, indexed together (`idx_memory_entries_nest_branch`).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N1["nest: project-alpha"] --> B1["branch: auth"]
    N1 --> B2["branch: api"]
    N2["nest: devops"] --> B3["branch: ci"]
    N2 --> B4["branch: monitoring"]
```

| Function | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `listNests()` | Aggregate active entries grouped by nest with counts |
| `listBranches(nest)` | List branches within a specific nest with counts |
| `getTaxonomyTree()` | Full tree: all nests, each with their branches and counts; totals for nests, branches, and memories |

Taxonomy values are set at store time via the `nest` and `branch` fields on `localnest_memory_store`. The MCP tools `localnest_nest_list`, `localnest_nest_branches`, and `localnest_nest_tree` expose the taxonomy read-side.

---

## Agent isolation (`taxonomy/scopes.ts`)

The agent diary provides private scratch space per agent. Each diary entry has an `agent_id`, `content`, optional `topic`, and a timestamp. Entries are stored in the `agent_diary` table and indexed by `(agent_id, created_at DESC)`.

Isolation is enforced at the query level — reads always filter by `agent_id`, so one agent cannot see another's diary.

| Function | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `writeDiaryEntry()` | Insert a diary entry scoped to `agent_id` |
| `readDiaryEntries()` | Paginated read of an agent's own diary, optionally filtered by topic |

Memory entries also carry an `agent_id` column (added in schema v8). When set, recalls and searches can filter by agent, providing soft scoping on shared memory.

---

## Semantic dedup (`store/dedup.ts`)

Before storing a new memory entry, the system can check for semantic duplicates using embedding cosine similarity.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    New["New content"] --> Embed["Embed text"]
    Embed --> Scan["Scan recent entries"]
    Scan -->|"similarity >= 0.92"| Dup["Duplicate — skip"]
    Scan -->|"similarity < 0.92"| Store["Store as new"]
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `threshold` | 0.92 | Cosine similarity cutoff (0-1) |
| `nest` | - | Filter candidates to a specific nest |
| `branch` | - | Filter candidates to a specific branch |
| `projectPath` | - | Filter candidates to a specific project |

The check scans up to 200 most-recently-updated entries that have embeddings, computes cosine similarity against each, and returns the best match above threshold. If the embedding service is unavailable, dedup is silently skipped (no false rejections).

---

## Conversation ingestion pipeline (`ingest/ingest.ts`)

Ingestion converts conversation exports (Markdown or JSON) into memory entries and KG triples in a single pipeline.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    File["Conversation file"] --> Parse["Parse turns"]
    Parse --> Dedup["Per-turn dedup check"]
    Dedup -->|"duplicate"| Skip["Skip turn"]
    Dedup -->|"unique"| Store["Store as memory entry"]
    Store --> Extract["Extract entities (regex)"]
    Extract --> Triples["Create KG triples"]
    Triples --> Record["Record source for re-ingestion tracking"]
```

### Supported formats

**Markdown** — recognizes three role-marker patterns:
- `## User` / `## Assistant` (heading style)
- `**User:**` (bold-colon style)
- `User:` (plain prefix)

**JSON** — array of `{role, content, timestamp?}` objects.

### Entity extraction

Rule-based regex heuristics extract entities from turn content:

| Pattern | Type | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Capitalized multi-word phrases | concept | "Knowledge Graph", "Machine Learning" |
| Quoted terms | concept | "entity extraction" |
| File paths | file | `src/services/memory/knowledge-graph/kg.ts` |
| URLs | url | `https://example.com` |
| ALL_CAPS identifiers | concept | `SCHEMA_VERSION` |

Common English stop words are filtered out. Extraction is capped at 50 entities per turn.

### Triple generation

For each turn's entities:
- Each entity gets a `mentioned_by` triple linking it to the turn's role
- Co-occurring entities (up to 10) get `co_occurs_with` triples linking each pair

### Re-ingestion tracking

The `conversation_sources` table records `(file_path, file_hash)` for each ingested file. If the same file with the same SHA-256 hash is ingested again, the pipeline returns `skipped: already_ingested` immediately.

---

## Hooks system (`hooks.ts`)

The `MemoryHooks` class provides a pub-sub mechanism for memory and KG operations. External consumers (AI clients, plugins, automation) can register pre/post callbacks.

### Event lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Before["before:store"] -->|"cancel?"| Op["Execute operation"]
    Op --> After["after:store"]
    Before -->|"cancel: true"| Skip["Operation skipped"]
    Op -->|"error"| Err["error event"]
```

### Valid events

| Category | Events |
|----------|--------|
| Memory lifecycle | `before:store`, `after:store`, `before:update`, `after:update`, `before:delete`, `after:delete`, `before:recall`, `after:recall` |
| Knowledge graph | `before:kg:addEntity`, `after:kg:addEntity`, `before:kg:addTriple`, `after:kg:addTriple`, `before:kg:invalidate`, `after:kg:invalidate` |
| Graph traversal | `before:graph:traverse`, `after:graph:traverse`, `before:graph:bridges`, `after:graph:bridges` |
| Agent diary | `before:diary:write`, `after:diary:write` |
| Ingestion | `before:ingest`, `after:ingest` |
| Dedup | `before:dedup`, `after:dedup` |
| Taxonomy | `before:nest:list`, `after:nest:list` |
| Wildcards | `before:*`, `after:*` (catch-all) |
| Errors | `error` |

### Hook behavior

- **before:** listeners can return `{ cancel: true }` to abort the operation, or `{ payload: modified }` to transform input
- **after:** listeners receive the result; cannot cancel
- **error:** listeners in error handlers are swallowed to prevent infinite loops
- `on()` returns a `{ remove }` handle; `once()` auto-removes after first call
- `setEnabled(false)` globally disables all hooks without unregistering them

---

## CLI architecture

The CLI (`src/cli/`) provides a `localnest` command with noun-verb subcommands and legacy flat commands.

### Module layout

```
src/cli/
├── help.ts          # Colored help renderer (raw ANSI, NO_COLOR/FORCE_COLOR aware)
├── options.ts       # Global flag parser (--json, --verbose, --quiet, --config)
├── router.ts        # Noun-verb routing + legacy fallback
└── commands/
    ├── memory.ts    # memory add|search|list|show|delete
    ├── kg.ts        # kg add|query|timeline|stats
    ├── skill.ts     # skill install|list|remove
    ├── mcp.ts       # mcp start|status|config
    ├── ingest.ts    # ingest <file>
    └── completion.ts # Shell completion generation
```

### Routing (`router.ts`)

The router uses two maps:

1. **NOUN_MODULES** — maps nouns (`memory`, `kg`, `skill`, `mcp`, `ingest`, `completion`) to handler modules. Each handler exports `run(args, opts)`.
2. **LEGACY_MODULES** — maps flat commands (`setup`, `doctor`, `upgrade`, `task-context`, `capture-outcome`) to standalone scripts for backward compatibility.

When `routeCommand(command, rest, globalOpts, binMetaUrl)` is called:
1. Check if `command` is a known noun → dynamic-import handler, call `run(rest, opts)`
2. Check if `command` is a legacy flat command → rewrite `process.argv` and import the script
3. Return `false` if unknown

### Service bootstrap pattern

Each command module follows the same pattern:
1. Import `buildRuntimeConfig()` from `src/runtime/config.ts`
2. Create an `EmbeddingService` from runtime config
3. Create a `MemoryService` passing runtime config + embedding service
4. Call service methods, format output as human-readable or `--json`

### Output modes

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output. Human output uses table formatting with padding/truncation helpers. The help renderer uses raw ANSI codes with `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR` environment variable support.

---

## Schema evolution (v5 → v9)

The memory database uses forward-only migrations. Each migration runs in a transaction and bumps `schema_version` in `memory_meta`. Current version: **9**.

| Version | What it adds |
|---------|-------------|
| **v5** | Composite indexes on `(scope_project_path, status, importance)` and `(kind, status)` for faster filtered queries |
| **v6** | `kg_entities` table (id, name, entity_type, properties_json, memory_id) and `kg_triples` table (subject_id, predicate, object_id, valid_from, valid_to, confidence, source_memory_id, source_type) with indexes on type, memory, subject, object, predicate, validity, and source |
| **v7** | `nest` and `branch` columns on `memory_entries` with composite index for taxonomy |
| **v8** | `agent_id` column on `memory_entries` with index; `agent_diary` table (id, agent_id, content, topic, created_at) with `(agent_id, created_at)` index |
| **v9** | `conversation_sources` table (id, file_path, file_hash, turn_count, memory_ids_json, ingested_at) with unique index on `(file_path, file_hash)` for re-ingestion tracking |

All migrations use `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` (with try/catch for idempotency) and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. Existing data is never dropped or rebuilt.

---

## How a tool call flows

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client["AI Client"] --> Handler["Tool handler"]
    Handler -->|"validate input"| Service["Service"]
    Service --> Storage["SQLite / Filesystem"]
    Storage --> Service
    Service --> Client
```

Tool handlers validate input with Zod, delegate all logic to a service, and return plain JSON. No business logic lives inside handlers.

---

## Background monitors

Two timers run silently in the background and never block process exit.

**Staleness monitor** — checks if indexed files changed on disk; re-indexes automatically. Disabled by default in stdio mode.

**Health monitor** — runs every 30 minutes:
- WAL checkpoint if write-ahead log exceeds 32 MB
- SQLite integrity check on both DBs
- Prunes orphan chunks and stale term stats
- Prunes old memory events (30d ignored / 365d all)
- Caps revision history at 50 per memory entry

Results are exposed via `localnest_health → background_health`.

---

## Configuration quick reference

| Env var | Default | What it controls |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `PROJECT_ROOTS` | CWD | Semicolon-separated root paths (`label=path;...`) |
| `LOCALNEST_INDEX_BACKEND` | `sqlite-vec` | `sqlite-vec` or `json` |
| `LOCALNEST_VECTOR_CHUNK_LINES` | `60` | Lines per index chunk |
| `LOCALNEST_VECTOR_CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `15` | Overlap between chunks |
| `LOCALNEST_EMBED_MODEL` | `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Embedding model |
| `LOCALNEST_MEMORY_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable memory subsystem |
| `LOCALNEST_HEALTH_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | `30` | Health monitor cadence (0 = off) |
| `LOCALNEST_INDEX_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | `0` | Staleness sweep cadence (0 = off) |

Full config reference: `src/runtime/config.ts`.

## Key decisions

**stdio only** — no HTTP server, no attack surface beyond the MCP protocol itself.

**Graceful degradation** — sqlite-vec missing → JSON fallback. ripgrep missing → TypeScript fallback. Memory disabled → retrieval unaffected. Embeddings unavailable → dedup silently skipped. Every optional subsystem fails independently.

**Local-first** — embeddings and reranking run via `@huggingface/transformers` with local ONNX/WASM runtime support. Nothing leaves the machine.

**Forward-only schema migrations** — `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` and `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` only. Existing databases are never dropped or rebuilt. Migration version tracked in `memory_meta`.

**Thin tool handlers** — handlers validate and delegate. All logic lives in services, keeping tool registration files readable at a glance.

**Temporal knowledge graph** — triples carry `valid_from`/`valid_to` bounds so facts can be invalidated without deletion. Point-in-time queries reconstruct state at any date.

**Agent isolation by convention** — diary entries and agent-scoped memory entries use `agent_id` as a query filter. No row-level security — isolation is enforced at the service layer.

**Hooks as extension point** — `MemoryHooks` provides before/after interception on all memory and KG operations without modifying core logic. Before-hooks can cancel or transform payloads.
