description: "Install, configure, and use LocalNest MCP for local code retrieval, with optional local memory workflows when the task actually benefits from them. Trigger this skill when user requests are about project files, code, repository data, or durable local agent memory under configured roots (for example: find symbol, read file, summarize project, search codebase, compare files, inspect folder tree, index/search local docs, recall prior project decisions, store agent memory). Use for setup, MCP config guidance, intent-based localnest_* tool routing, memory recall/capture flow, and troubleshooting for doctor/import/file-size/search/index issues."

# LocalNest MCP

Run end-user installation and usage workflows for LocalNest MCP.

## AI Activation Rules

Activate LocalNest MCP when:
- User asks about code, files, symbols, or project structure in local repositories.
- User asks to search or read content from data already present in configured roots.
- User asks for project summaries, root/project listing, or targeted file ranges.
- User asks semantic/hybrid retrieval over local code/docs.
- User asks to preserve, recall, inspect, or manage local agent memory tied to a project.

Do not activate LocalNest MCP when:
- User asks for internet-only/current-events data.
- User asks about files outside configured LocalNest roots.
- User asks non-repository tasks unrelated to local project data.

Decision shortcut:
1. If query depends on local repo content → use LocalNest.
2. If query depends on web/current external content → use web search.
3. If both are needed → use LocalNest for local facts, then web for external facts.

## Install And Configure

Prefer global install for stable behavior.

1. Install package.
```bash
npm install -g localnest-mcp
```

2. Install/update bundled skill.
```bash
localnest-mcp-install-skill
```

3. Run setup + health check.
```bash
localnest-mcp-setup
localnest-mcp-doctor
```

4. Copy the printed `mcpServers.localnest` JSON block into the MCP client config.
5. Restart MCP client.

Fallback only when global install is unavailable:
```bash
npx -y localnest-mcp-setup
npx -y localnest-mcp-doctor
```

## Use LocalNest Tools

Default retrieval workflow:
1. `localnest_server_status`
2. `localnest_list_roots`
3. `localnest_list_projects`
4. **`localnest_search_files`** ← start here for module/feature discovery
5. `localnest_search_code` ← use for exact symbols, identifiers, and error strings
6. `localnest_index_status`
7. `localnest_index_project`
8. `localnest_search_hybrid` ← for concept/content retrieval
9. `localnest_read_file`

Optional memory workflow:
1. `localnest_task_context` ← preferred one-call runtime + memory context for substantive tasks
2. `localnest_capture_outcome` ← preferred one-call outcome capture after meaningful work
3. `localnest_memory_status` / `localnest_memory_recall` / `localnest_memory_capture_event` ← use only when lower-level control is needed

Automatic memory triggers:
- Run `localnest_task_context` before deeper analysis when the task involves debugging, implementation, code review, repeated repo work, or user/project preferences.
- Run `localnest_capture_outcome` after:
  - a confirmed bug fix
  - a design or implementation decision
  - a review finding or regression risk the user should remember
  - a reusable workflow or project-specific constraint
  - a user preference that should affect later behavior
- Do **not** capture memory for simple browsing, dead-end investigation, or one-off factual lookups with no durable value.

Call `localnest_usage_guide` at any time to get embedded best-practice guidance from the server itself.

### Adaptive AI behavior (important)

Do not run the full sequence blindly on every request. Adapt by intent:
- If user asks for an exact symbol/import/error string: start with `localnest_search_code`.
- If user asks "where is X module/feature": start with `localnest_search_files`.
- If user asks concept/"how it works": run `localnest_search_hybrid` (after index check).
- If user already gave a file path + line concern: go directly to `localnest_read_file`.
- If index is stale/empty: run `localnest_index_project` only for the needed `project_path`.
- If memory is enabled and the task is non-trivial: run `localnest_task_context` before analysis.
- Do not front-load memory tools on simple file lookups, exact symbol searches, or one-shot reads.
- After a bug fix, design decision, review outcome, reusable workflow discovery, or user preference discovery: emit `localnest_capture_outcome`.

Answer strategy:
- Prefer shortest path to evidence.
- Scope aggressively (`project_path`, `glob`) before broad search.
- Read narrow ranges first, then widen only when needed.
- Always include actionable next command if evidence is incomplete (for example: "next run `localnest_search_code` with `use_regex=true`").

### AI quality rules (critical)

- Do not answer from memory when a LocalNest tool can verify it.
- Use memory as guidance, not as final evidence. Verify with code/file tools before concluding.
- Prefer explicit retrieval tools over memory whenever the user is asking for a direct file/code answer.
- If memory is enabled and the task changed code, resolved an issue, or uncovered a reusable repo rule, you should usually emit `localnest_capture_outcome` before finishing.
- Cite concrete files/lines after `localnest_read_file` before giving conclusions.
- If search is empty, show what was searched (`query`, `project_path`, `glob`) and immediately try a fallback strategy (synonyms, regex, broader scope).
- For bug triage, run both:
  - `localnest_search_code` for exact error/symbol
  - `localnest_search_hybrid` for architecture/context
- If memory is enabled, also run `localnest_task_context` for prior fixes/preferences in the same scope.
- If `updates.is_outdated=true`, ask the user:
  - "LocalNest has a newer version. Do you want to update now?"
  - If user approves, call `localnest_update_self(approved_by_user=true)`.

### Finding modules by name (acronyms, domain terms)

When looking for a module like "SSO", "payments", "IAM":
1. **Use `localnest_search_files` first** — searches file paths and directory names. Far faster than content search for module discovery. Finds `sso.service.ts`, `auth/sso/`, `SSOController.js` immediately.
2. **Try synonyms** — acronyms rarely appear consistently in code. SSO → try `oauth`, `saml`, `passport`, `auth`. Payments → try `stripe`, `billing`, `invoice`, `checkout`.
3. **Then use `localnest_search_hybrid`** — once you know the file/directory, search for implementation details within that scope using `project_path`.
4. **Regex search** — `localnest_search_code` with `use_regex=true` and a pattern like `SSO|single.sign` for broad content scan. No need to escape for fixed-string mode when `use_regex=false` (default).

### Reading matches with context

When you expect to read surrounding code after a `localnest_search_code` hit, pass `context_lines=3` to get 3 lines before and after each match inline. This avoids a separate `localnest_read_file` call per result:
```
localnest_search_code(query="getUserById", context_lines=3)
```
Each result then has `context_before: [...]` and `context_after: [...]` arrays.

## Tool Reference

### `localnest_search_files`
Searches file paths and names for a query string. **Use this first when looking for a module or feature by name.** Params: `query` (required), `project_path` (optional), `all_roots`, `max_results`, `case_sensitive` (default false). Returns `file`, `relative_path`, `name` per match.

### `localnest_usage_guide`
Returns structured best-practice guidance for users and AI agents. No params. Call this when unsure about the correct workflow.

### `localnest_server_status`
Returns runtime config: active roots, ripgrep status, index backend (`sqlite-vec` or `json`), chunk settings, and update status metadata. Always call first in a new session.

### `localnest_memory_status`
Returns memory consent state, backend compatibility, active database path, and store status. Call before using memory tools. If memory is disabled, do not use recall/capture tools until the user opts in during setup.

### `localnest_task_context`
Returns runtime status, memory state, and relevant recall in one call. Prefer this over manually chaining `localnest_memory_status` + `localnest_memory_recall` for non-trivial tasks.

### `localnest_memory_recall`
Recalls the most relevant local memories for a task/query. Params:
- `query` (required)
- `project_path` (optional)
- `topic` (optional)
- `kind` (`knowledge` or `preference`)
- `limit`

Use at the start of substantive tasks when memory is enabled. Treat results as hints that must be verified against current files.

### `localnest_capture_outcome`
Captures a meaningful task outcome with a simpler payload (`task`, `summary`, `details`, scope, file/test metadata) and forwards it into the memory event pipeline. Prefer this over `localnest_memory_capture_event` when you do not need low-level event control.

### `localnest_memory_capture_event`
Background event ingest tool for automatic memory flow. Params:
- `event_type` (`task`, `bugfix`, `decision`, `review`, `preference`)
- `status` (`in_progress`, `completed`, `resolved`, `ignored`, `merged`)
- `title`
- `summary`
- `content`
- `files_changed`
- `has_tests`
- `tags`
- `links`
- `scope`
- `source_ref`

Use this after meaningful work. High-signal events are auto-promoted into durable memory; weak exploratory events are recorded and ignored. Explicit use of this tool is allowed even when automatic background capture is turned off.

### `localnest_memory_events`
Lists recent memory capture events and whether they were promoted into durable memory. Use to inspect background capture behavior.

### `localnest_memory_list`
Lists stored memories. Supports filtering by `kind`, `status`, `project_path`, `topic`, `limit`, and `offset`.

### `localnest_memory_get`
Fetches a memory entry with revision history.

### `localnest_memory_store`
Manual durable memory write. Use for explicit corrections or when automatic capture is not appropriate.

### `localnest_memory_update`
Updates a memory and appends a revision.

### `localnest_memory_delete`
Deletes a memory entry and all its revisions.

### `localnest_update_status`
Checks npm for latest package version with local caching (default interval 120 minutes). Params: `force_check` (bool, default false). Use this to decide whether to ask user to update.

### `localnest_update_self`
Performs global self-update and skill sync. Params:
- `approved_by_user` (required safety gate; must be true)
- `dry_run` (bool, default false)
- `version` (default `latest`)
- `reinstall_skill` (bool, default true)

This tool should only be called after explicit user approval.

### `localnest_list_roots`
Lists configured roots. Supports `limit` / `offset` pagination.

### `localnest_list_projects`
Lists first-level projects under a root. Params: `root_path` (optional), `limit`, `offset`.

### `localnest_project_tree`
Returns compact file/folder tree. Params: `project_path` (required), `max_depth` (1–8, default 3), `max_entries` (default 1500). Start with low `max_depth`, expand if needed.

### `localnest_index_status`
Returns semantic index metadata (exists, stale, backend, file count). Use before indexing.

### `localnest_index_project`
Builds or refreshes semantic index. Params:
- `project_path` (optional) — scope to one project
- `all_roots` (bool, default false) — index all roots
- `force` (bool, default false) — rebuild even if fresh
- `max_files` (default 20000) — cap on files indexed

Prefer project-scoped over all-roots for speed. Returns `failed_files: [{path, error}]` for any files that could not be indexed (large binaries, permission errors) — the rest of the index still commits.

**After upgrading to v0.0.2-beta.3:** the index schema version changed (improved tokenizer + inverted index). The server auto-clears stale index data on first run. Run `localnest_index_project` once after upgrade.

### `localnest_search_code`
Lexical search (ripgrep or JS fallback). Use for exact symbol names, identifiers, or regex patterns. Params:
- `query` (required)
- `project_path` (optional)
- `all_roots` (bool, default false)
- `glob` (file filter pattern, default `*`) — use `**/*.ts` for recursive extension filter, not `*.ts`
- `max_results` (default varies)
- `case_sensitive` (bool, default false)
- `use_regex` (bool, default false) — treat query as ripgrep regex (e.g. `async\s+function\s+get\w+`)
- `context_lines` (int 0–10, default 0) — include N surrounding lines with each match; reduces follow-up `read_file` calls

### `localnest_search_hybrid`
Lexical + semantic search with RRF ranking. Best for concept-level or natural-language queries. Requires `localnest_index_project` to have been run first. Params:
- `query` (required)
- `project_path` (optional) — combine with this for precision
- `all_roots` (bool, default false)
- `glob` (file filter pattern, default `*`) — use `**/*.ts` not `*.ts` for recursive extension filter
- `max_results`
- `case_sensitive` (bool, default false)
- `min_semantic_score` (0–1, default 0.05) — raise to filter weak semantic hits
- `auto_index` (bool, default true) — if semantic index has no hits, LocalNest auto-runs a one-time scoped index bootstrap and retries semantic retrieval

Results include `semantic_score_raw` (actual cosine score) alongside `rrf_score` for filtering by real relevance.

### `localnest_read_file`
Reads a bounded line window from a file with line numbers. Params: `path`, `start_line` (default 1), `end_line` (default cap). **Window is capped at 800 lines.** Oversized windows return available content with warning metadata — no hard failure. Read narrow ranges first, then expand.

### `localnest_summarize_project`
High-level summary: language breakdown, extension stats, file counts. Params: `project_path` (required), `max_files` (default 3000).

## Usage Rules

- All tools accept `response_format: "json"` (default, for processing) or `"markdown"` (for readable output).
- For list tools, pass `limit` + `offset`; continue while `has_more` is true using `next_offset`.
- Prefer `project_path` for focused retrieval. Use `all_roots=true` only for cross-project queries.
- Canonical names are `localnest_*`.
- Short aliases are intentionally not exposed to keep tool lists clean and avoid duplicates in MCP clients.

## Evidence-First Pattern

1. Discover scope (`localnest_list_roots`, `localnest_list_projects`).
2. **Find module/feature** (`localnest_search_files`) — search by path/name first.
3. Retrieve content (`localnest_search_hybrid` or `localnest_search_code`) scoped to the found path.
4. Validate with exact lines (`localnest_read_file`).
5. If the task is substantive and memory is enabled, run `localnest_task_context`.
6. Answer with file-grounded results.
7. After meaningful work, emit `localnest_capture_outcome`.

## Hook-Friendly CLI

For deterministic client hooks or shell automation, use:
- `localnest-mcp-task-context`
- `localnest-mcp-capture-outcome`

Both commands accept either flags or a JSON payload on stdin.

## Troubleshooting

### Doctor fails with MCP SDK import error

Symptom: `sdk_import` check fails (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).

Fix:
```bash
npm install
localnest-mcp-doctor
```

### ripgrep missing

Ripgrep is **optional** from v0.0.2-beta.3. If `rg` is not found, the server starts normally and search tools fall back to a JS filesystem walker (slower but fully functional). The `has_ripgrep` field in `localnest_server_status` shows the active state.

To get full performance, install ripgrep:
- macOS: `brew install ripgrep`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install ripgrep`
- Windows: `winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC`

Then set PATH in your MCP client env if `rg` is installed but still not found.

### File exceeds size cap in `read_file`

LocalNest caps reads at 800 lines per window. Oversized requests return available content with warning metadata. Narrow your `start_line`/`end_line` range.

### MCP startup timeout

If client shows timeout like "MCP client for localnest timed out after 10 seconds", set:

```toml
[mcp_servers.localnest]
startup_timeout_sec = 30
```

### Semantic search returns no results after upgrading to beta.3

The index schema changed in v0.0.2-beta.3 (improved tokenizer + inverted index). The old index is automatically cleared on first server start. Run `localnest_index_project` to rebuild it.

### glob `*.ts` returns no results from subdirectories

Use `**/*.ts` not `*.ts`. The glob is matched against the relative file path from the base — `*.ts` only matches files at the root level of the search scope. `**/*.ts` matches recursively.

### sqlite-vec unavailable

LocalNest auto-falls back to JSON backend. Confirm active backend via:
- `localnest_server_status` → `vector_index.backend` (actual) vs `vector_index.requested_backend` (configured)
- `localnest_index_status`

### Memory disabled or unavailable

Check:
- `localnest_memory_status`

Common causes:
- User did not opt in during `localnest-mcp-setup`
- Memory backend unavailable on the current runtime

If disabled, continue using retrieval tools normally and ask the user to rerun setup if they want memory enabled.

### Duplicate-looking tools in MCP clients

Stable releases expose canonical `localnest_*` tools only.
