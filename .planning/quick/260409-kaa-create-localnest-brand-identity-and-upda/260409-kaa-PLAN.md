<objective>
Apply LocalNest brand identity (tagline, nest metaphor, SEO keywords) to README.md and fix all broken internal links across README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and architecture.md caused by the folder restructuring.

Purpose: Establish warm, protective brand voice and ensure all doc cross-references work after guides/ and readme/ moved to localnest-docs/docs/.
Output: Three updated files with brand identity and correct paths.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Apply brand identity to README.md and fix all broken links</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Edit README.md with the following changes:

**Brand identity (per locked decisions in CONTEXT.md):**

1. Replace line 13 tagline `**Your codebase. Your AI. Your machine — no cloud, no leaks, no surprises.**` with:
   `**Your AI's home base.**`

2. Replace lines 15-17 (the description + feature bar) with a branded version that weaves the nest metaphor warmly:
   - Lead with the nest metaphor: LocalNest is where your AI builds its nest — on YOUR machine. It learns, remembers, and protects your code. The nest grows with you but never leaves home.
   - Weave SEO keywords naturally: "local MCP server", "private AI coding assistant", "persistent AI memory", "semantic code search", "AI knowledge graph", "no-cloud AI tools", "local-first development"
   - Keep the feature stat bar (52 MCP tools, TypeScript, etc.) but integrate it into the new voice
   - Tone: warm and protective, like a guardian — per the "Warm & Protective" decision

3. In the "Why LocalNest?" section (line 48+): Weave SEO terms "offline AI code tools", "private code assistant", "local-first development" into the opening paragraph naturally. Keep the existing content but warm the tone slightly with the nest metaphor where it fits organically. Do NOT force metaphors into technical tables.

4. In the "Memory" section heading area (line 351+): Add "persistent AI memory" and "AI knowledge graph" keywords naturally in the opening paragraph.

**Link fixes (all broken by restructuring):**

5. Line 19: Change `./guides/architecture.md` to `./localnest-docs/docs/guides/architecture.md`

6. Line 23: Change all `./readme/README.XX-XX.md` links to `./localnest-docs/docs/i18n/README.XX-XX.md` (13 translation links)

7. Line 25: Change `./readme/TRANSLATION_POLICY.md` to `./localnest-docs/docs/i18n/TRANSLATION_POLICY.md`

8. Line 494: Change `./guides/architecture.md` to `./localnest-docs/docs/guides/architecture.md`

Keep all other content exactly as-is. Do not add or remove sections. The nest metaphor should feel organic in intro/overview sections and fade to technical in feature tables.

  <done>README.md has new tagline "Your AI's home base", nest metaphor story in intro, SEO keywords woven through headings and descriptions, and all 16 broken links (2 architecture, 13 i18n, 1 translation policy) point to localnest-docs/ paths</done>

  <name>Task 2: Fix broken links in CONTRIBUTING.md</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Edit CONTRIBUTING.md with these link fixes:

1. Line 50: Change `[`guides/architecture.md`](./guides/architecture.md)` to `[`localnest-docs/docs/guides/architecture.md`](./localnest-docs/docs/guides/architecture.md)`

2. Line 51: Change `[`guides/future-retrieval-roadmap.md`](./guides/future-retrieval-roadmap.md)` to `[`localnest-docs/docs/guides/future-retrieval-roadmap.md`](./localnest-docs/docs/guides/future-retrieval-roadmap.md)`

No other changes. Keep all existing content intact.

  <name>Task 3: Update architecture.md source layout and inline file references</name>
  <files>localnest-docs/docs/guides/architecture.md</files>
  <action>
Edit localnest-docs/docs/guides/architecture.md with these changes:

**Source layout tree (lines 454-490):** Replace the flat memory/ listing with the new subdirectory structure:

```
│   ├── memory/
│   │   ├── schema.ts        # table DDL + forward-only migrations (v1-v9)
│   │   ├── store.ts         # MemoryStore facade — wires all modules together

│   │       ├── scopes.ts    # agent diary + agent-scoped isolation
│   │       └── taxonomy.ts  # nest/branch hierarchy queries
```

**Inline file references — update parenthetical refs to show subdirectory paths:**
- Line 137: `kg.ts` and `graph.ts` -> `knowledge-graph/kg.ts` and `knowledge-graph/graph.ts`
- Line 139: `(kg.ts)` -> `(knowledge-graph/kg.ts)`
- Line 165: `(graph.ts)` -> `(knowledge-graph/graph.ts)`
- Line 184: `(relations.ts)` -> `(knowledge-graph/relations.ts)`
- Line 190: `taxonomy.ts` -> `taxonomy/taxonomy.ts`
- Line 215: `(scopes.ts)` -> `(taxonomy/scopes.ts)`
- Line 230: `(dedup.ts)` -> `(store/dedup.ts)`
- Line 253: `(ingest.ts)` -> `(ingest/ingest.ts)`
- Line 303: `(hooks.ts)` -> stays as `(hooks.ts)` (hooks.ts did NOT move, stays at memory root)

Keep all other content exactly as-is. The file-path example in the entity extraction table (line 285, `src/services/memory/kg.ts`) is showing a pattern example, update it to `src/services/memory/knowledge-graph/kg.ts` for accuracy.
