<objective>
Fix the three nest/branch parameter pass-through bugs that leave `memory_entries.nest` and `memory_entries.branch` empty for every capture path, which in turn makes `nest_tree` and `graph_bridges` return zero rows despite 64 live memories.

Purpose: Unblock the `nest_tree` and `graph_bridges` MCP tools on existing writes going forward, without waiting for Phase 34 SLIM-07 (auto-inference) or Phase 35 (backfill). This is pure wiring — the storage columns, migrations, indexes, and downstream queries already work; the values just never arrive.

Output:
- `nest` and `branch` added as optional string fields on the three MCP tool schemas so agents can set them
- `captureOutcome` in workflow.ts forwards `input.nest`/`input.branch` into its `captureInput`
- `captureEvent` in events/capture.ts forwards `input.nest`/`input.branch` into its `storeEntry` call
- `storeEntry` fallback no longer writes absolute filesystem paths; uses `path.basename(project_path)` for nest and sanitized `scope.branch_name` for branch
- Regression test asserts all three behaviors

  <name>Task 1: Expose nest and branch on the three MCP tool input schemas (Bug 1)</name>
  <files>src/mcp/tools/memory-store.ts, src/mcp/tools/memory-workflow.ts</files>
  <action>
    Agents calling through MCP cannot currently set `nest` or `branch` because the zod `inputSchema` blocks for three tools do not list them. Add them as optional, max-200-char strings matching the cleanString cap used by storeEntry.

    **Edit 1 — `src/mcp/tools/memory-store.ts`:**

    A) In the `localnest_memory_store` tool block (registerJsonTool call starting at line 121), inside the `inputSchema: { ... }` object (lines 126-140), add two new entries just after the existing `scope: MEMORY_SCOPE_SCHEMA,` line:
    ```ts
    nest: z.string().max(200).optional(),
    branch: z.string().max(200).optional(),
    ```

    B) In the `localnest_memory_capture_event` tool block (registerJsonTool call starting at line 214), inside the `inputSchema: { ... }` object (lines 219-234), add the same two entries just after the existing `scope: MEMORY_SCOPE_SCHEMA,` line:
    ```ts
    nest: z.string().max(200).optional(),
    branch: z.string().max(200).optional(),
    ```

    No other changes in this file. The handlers already spread `args` through to the underlying service methods (see `memory.storeEntry(args)` at line 149 and `memory.captureEvent(args)` at line 242), so once the schema accepts the fields, zod will pass them through untouched.

    **Edit 2 — `src/mcp/tools/memory-workflow.ts`:**

    In the `localnest_capture_outcome` tool block (registerJsonTool call at line 132), inside the `inputSchema: { ... }` object (lines 137-158), add two new entries just after the existing `feature: z.string().optional(),` line (line 156):
    ```ts
    nest: z.string().max(200).optional(),
    branch: z.string().max(200).optional(),
    ```

    No other changes — the handler already calls `memoryWorkflow.captureOutcome(args)` which is wired up in Task 2.

    **Why not also add agent_id, status, etc.?** Out of scope. We're ONLY unblocking nest_tree and graph_bridges. Resist the urge to cleanup adjacent schemas.

    **Rationale for `.optional()` (not `.default('')`):** An empty string default would hide the "not provided" case from the server-side fallback logic in Task 3 — we need `undefined` to trigger the basename derivation. Match the existing `importance?: number | undefined` pattern used elsewhere in these schemas.

  <name>Task 2: Forward nest and branch through captureOutcome and captureEvent (Bug 2)</name>
  <files>src/services/memory/workflow.ts, src/services/memory/events/capture.ts</files>
  <action>
    Even after Task 1 makes the schemas accept `nest`/`branch`, the values still get dropped at two intermediate layers. Fix both.

    **Edit 1 — `src/services/memory/workflow.ts` (captureOutcome method):**

    The `captureOutcome` method at lines 146-214 builds a fresh `captureInput` object at lines 179-204 and passes it to `this.memory.captureEvent(captureInput)`. It does NOT currently forward `input.nest`/`input.branch`, so even an agent that supplies them via the new schema from Task 1 will see them discarded.

    Inside that captureInput object literal (between `scope: { ... }` at line 196-202 and `source_ref: ...` at line 203), add:
    ```ts
    nest: input.nest as string | undefined,
    branch: input.branch as string | undefined,
    ```

    Place them immediately after the closing `},` of the `scope` sub-object and before the `source_ref` field, to match the ordering already used by the CaptureEventInput interface in types.ts.

    **Edit 2 — `src/services/memory/events/capture.ts` (captureEvent function):**

    The `captureEvent` function already reads `input.nest` at line 84 for the dedup check, which proves this layer KNOWS about nest. But the `storeEntry` call at lines 127-141 in the non-merge promotion path does not forward it.

    In the storeEntry call (lines 127-141), add two lines inside the object literal. Place them after `scope,` (line 137) and before `source_type: 'capture-event',` (line 138):
    ```ts
    nest: input.nest,
    branch: input.branch,
    ```

    Do NOT add them to the `updateEntry` merge-target path (lines 105-123) — that's the merge branch and merge semantics for nest/branch are out of scope for this quick task (merge target already has its own nest/branch from the prior insert).

    **Do NOT touch:** the dedup call at line 83-87 (already correct), the memory_events INSERT at lines 148-172 (memory_events table is a separate audit log; no nest/branch columns exist there per current schema — confirmed via grep of schema.ts).

    **Type safety:** The `CaptureEventInput` interface in `src/services/memory/types.ts` lines 274-275 already declares `nest?: string; branch?: string;` — no type changes needed.

  <name>Task 3: Fix storeEntry fallback to derive nest basename and sanitize branch (Bug 3)</name>
  <files>src/services/memory/store/entries.ts</files>
  <action>
    The fallback at `src/services/memory/store/entries.ts` lines 152-153 currently writes absolute filesystem paths into `memory_entries.nest`:
    ```ts
    const nest = cleanString(input.nest || scope.project_path || '', 200);
    const branch = cleanString(input.branch || scope.topic || '', 200);
    ```

    Two bugs:
    1. `scope.project_path` is an absolute path like `/mnt/da2ae3dd-.../Base Projects/localnest` — grouping by that is useless because every install has a different absolute path. We want the project basename (`localnest`).
    2. `scope.topic` is a semantic topic (e.g. "auth") that's already handled elsewhere — the natural fallback for `branch` is `scope.branch_name` (the git branch), not topic.

    **Edit — `src/services/memory/store/entries.ts`:**

    1) At the top of the file (after line 1's `import fs from 'node:fs';`), add:
    ```ts
    import path from 'node:path';
    ```

    2) Replace lines 152-153 with:
    ```ts
    const rawNestFallback = scope.project_path ? path.basename(scope.project_path) : '';
    const rawBranchFallback = (scope.branch_name || scope.topic || '').replace(/[/\\]/g, '-');
    const nest = cleanString(input.nest || rawNestFallback, 200);
    const branch = cleanString(input.branch || rawBranchFallback, 200);
    ```

    **Why this exact shape:**
    - `path.basename` of an empty string returns `''`, so guard with the ternary to avoid `path.basename('')` noise.
    - Branch fallback chain: explicit `input.branch` > `scope.branch_name` (the actual git branch) > `scope.topic` (legacy compat with existing callers) > empty string. The legacy `scope.topic` fallback is retained so we don't break the current 7 manual memories' rehydration path — topic was the old fallback and some callers may depend on it.
    - `replace(/[/\\]/g, '-')` strips slashes so a git branch name like `release/0.2.0` becomes `release-0.2.0` — important because `graph_bridges` groups by exact string match and slashes in a "branch" column are confusing on read. This mirrors standard git ref sanitization used throughout the codebase.
    - `cleanString(..., 200)` preserves the existing 200-char cap and whitespace normalization.

    **Do NOT touch:**
    - The `updateEntry` function at lines 248-330 — its `nest`/`branch` handling at lines 277-278 uses `patch.nest ?? existing.nest` which is correct (preserves existing values on update). Fixing updateEntry's fallback would break the contract that unspecified patch fields don't mutate the row.
    - The `scope.project_path` writes to `scope_project_path` column at line 221 — that column intentionally stores the absolute path and is the canonical identifier. We're only fixing the `nest` column's derivation.

    **File size check:** entries.ts is 344 lines. Adding 3 net lines keeps it at 347, well under the 500-line CLAUDE.md cap.

    - `import path from 'node:path';` appears as line 2 (or adjacent to the `import fs` line)
    - The exact string `path.basename(scope.project_path)` appears exactly once in entries.ts
    - The old literal `scope.project_path || ''` inside the `nest` fallback is gone
    - The old `scope.topic` remains only as part of the `branch` fallback chain (after `scope.branch_name`)
    - `grep -n "replace(/\[/\\\\\]/g"` returns one match inside storeEntry (branch sanitization)
    - `updateEntry` function (lines ~248-330) is unchanged — its `patch.nest ?? existing.nest ?? ''` fallback still works

  <name>Task 4: Regression tests for pass-through and basename fallback</name>
  <files>test/memory-nest-branch-wiring.test.js</files>
  <behavior>
    Test 1 — explicit pass-through via MemoryStore.storeEntry:
      - Given: storeEntry called with { nest: 'localnest', branch: 'release/0.2.0', content: 'x', title: 't', scope: { project_path: '/tmp/foo' } }
      - Expect: listEntries (or getEntry) returns row with nest === 'localnest' and branch === 'release/0.2.0'
      - Note: we pass 'release/0.2.0' explicitly — the explicit path should preserve slashes as-is (cleanString only trims, doesn't replace slashes). Sanitization only fires on the fallback path.

    Test 2 — explicit pass-through via MemoryStore.captureEvent:
      - Given: captureEvent called with { event_type: 'task', status: 'completed', title: 't', content: 'something meaningful to clear the promotion threshold blah blah', nest: 'my-nest', branch: 'my-branch', scope: { project_path: '/tmp/foo' }, importance: 90 }
      - Expect: result.status === 'promoted', then listEntries returns a row with nest === 'my-nest' and branch === 'my-branch'
      - Use high importance to force promotion past the threshold deterministically
      - If the event doesn't promote (status !== 'promoted'), skip the row assertion with a t.diagnostic so the test doesn't become flaky on threshold changes

    Test 3 — basename fallback when nest is omitted:
      - Given: storeEntry called with { content: 'y', title: 't2', scope: { project_path: '/mnt/da2ae3dd-9788-4b37-88e8-effd7025eb4c/Base Projects/localnest', branch_name: 'release/0.2.0' } } and NO explicit nest/branch
      - Expect: getEntry / listEntries returns row with nest === 'localnest' (NOT the full path) and branch === 'release-0.2.0' (slashes replaced with hyphens)

    Test 4 — branch slash sanitization only on fallback, not on explicit input:
      - Given: storeEntry with explicit branch: 'feature/foo/bar'
      - Expect: stored branch === 'feature/foo/bar' (unchanged — slashes only get stripped on the fallback path)

    All tests must skip gracefully via hasSupportedBackend() pattern when node:sqlite is unavailable, matching existing test/memory-store.test.js convention.

    NO tests for the merge path, dedup, embedding service, or updateEntry — out of scope.
  </behavior>
  <action>
    Create a new file at `test/memory-nest-branch-wiring.test.js`. Use the same imports and helpers as the existing `test/memory-store.test.js`:

    ```js
    import test from 'node:test';
    import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    import path from 'node:path';
    import os from 'node:os';
    import { MemoryStore } from '../src/services/memory/index.js';

    function makeTempDir() {
      return fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'localnest-nest-branch-test-'));
    }

    async function hasSupportedBackend() {
      try {
        const mod = await import('node:sqlite');
        if (mod?.DatabaseSync) return true;
      } catch {}
      return false;
    }
    ```

    Write one `test(...)` per behavior listed above (4 tests total). Each test:
    1. Creates its own tempDir + MemoryStore instance (isolation)
    2. Calls `store.storeEntry(...)` or `store.captureEvent(...)`
    3. Asserts via `store.listEntries({ projectPath: '...' })` OR `store.getEntry(id)` that the `nest` and `branch` columns hold the expected values
    4. `fs.rmSync(root, { recursive: true, force: true })` at the end

    **Important — how to read stored nest/branch:**
    Looking at `src/services/memory/store/entries.ts` lines 97-107, `listEntries` already selects `nest, branch` and `deserializeEntry` should map them. If the deserialized entry object doesn't expose them as top-level `item.nest`/`item.branch`, fall back to querying via `getEntry(id)` which selects `SELECT *` at line 122 — the raw row will include the columns. If still not exposed, use the MemoryStore's underlying adapter directly:
    ```js
    const row = await store.adapter.get('SELECT nest, branch FROM memory_entries WHERE id = ?', [id]);
    assert.equal(row.nest, 'localnest');
    ```
    The `adapter` is public on the MemoryStoreLike interface (see entries.ts line 18 and test/memory-store.test.js passim).

    **Promotion threshold reliability for Test 2:** `computeSignalScore` in events/heuristics.ts multiplies importance into the signal — passing `importance: 90` plus `status: 'completed'` and a task event type should reliably clear the default threshold. If the test becomes flaky, use `t.diagnostic(...)` to log `result.status` and `t.skip()` rather than failing, so the wiring fix is never blocked by unrelated heuristic tuning.

    **Do NOT:**
    - Create an MCP server instance or exercise the zod schemas end-to-end — Task 1's changes are verified by the grep in Task 1's `<verify>`. End-to-end MCP tests are expensive and covered by test/mcp-tools.test.js for schema registration.
    - Test the merge path, dedup, or updateEntry behavior.
    - Create a `.ts` test file. Convention is `.test.js` plain ESM (see existing test/memory-store.test.js).
    - Save test file anywhere other than /test per CLAUDE.md "Use /tests for test files" (project uses /test singular — follow existing convention, do NOT create a /tests directory).

   - `grep -n "nest: z.string().max(200).optional()" src/mcp/tools/memory-workflow.ts` shows the field inside the capture_outcome inputSchema block
   - `grep -n "nest: input.nest" src/services/memory/workflow.ts` shows the pass-through inside captureOutcome's captureInput literal
   - End-to-end: captureOutcome -> captureEvent -> storeEntry all now forward nest/branch

4. **Basename fallback when project_path is absolute and nest is omitted:**
   - `grep -n "path.basename(scope.project_path)" src/services/memory/store/entries.ts` shows exactly one hit
   - Test 3 in task 4 asserts `/mnt/...localnest` becomes `nest: 'localnest'` in the stored row
   - Test 3 also asserts `release/0.2.0` becomes `branch: 'release-0.2.0'` when branch is omitted

5. **Backwards compat — explicit values are NOT re-sanitized:**
   - Test 4 in task 4 asserts explicit `branch: 'feature/foo/bar'` survives intact (cleanString only trims, doesn't replace slashes on explicit input)
   - No changes to response shapes — normalizers in src/mcp/common/response-normalizers.ts are untouched
   - No changes to memory_events INSERT or schema migrations

6. **Existing test suite does not regress:**
   - `npx tsx --test test/memory-store.test.js` passes (nest/branch columns already existed; we only fixed the derivation)
   - `npx tsx --test test/memory-workflow-service.test.js` passes (captureOutcome now accepts more fields but doesn't require them)

7. **Constraint compliance:**
   - No `npm run build` invocation per "dont build app until prompted" rule
   - No new runtime dependencies (only node:path which is built-in)
   - No new documentation files created beyond the mandatory SUMMARY.md at the end
   - All modified files stay under 500 lines (memory-store.ts ~361, memory-workflow.ts ~170, workflow.ts ~218, capture.ts ~184, entries.ts ~347)
   - No existing memory data modified — only forward-going writes are fixed. Backfill remains Phase 35.

<success_criteria>
All four tasks complete, with:

1. Three MCP tool schemas (`localnest_memory_store`, `localnest_memory_capture_event`, `localnest_capture_outcome`) now declare `nest` and `branch` as optional z.string().max(200) fields
2. `captureOutcome` in workflow.ts forwards `input.nest`/`input.branch` into the captureInput payload
3. `captureEvent` in events/capture.ts forwards `input.nest`/`input.branch` into the storeEntry call (non-merge path only)
4. `storeEntry` in store/entries.ts derives `nest` from `path.basename(scope.project_path)` when no explicit nest is provided, and derives `branch` from `scope.branch_name` (falling back to `scope.topic` for legacy compat), with slashes replaced by hyphens on the fallback only
5. Regression test file `test/memory-nest-branch-wiring.test.js` exists with 4 tests and `npx tsx --test test/memory-nest-branch-wiring.test.js` exits 0
6. `npx tsx --test test/memory-store.test.js` still exits 0 (no regression)
7. No file modified exceeds 500 lines
8. No new runtime dependencies added
9. No documentation files created beyond SUMMARY.md
10. `git diff --stat` shows exactly 6 files touched (5 src edits + 1 new test file)

**Non-goals explicitly rejected (do NOT implement):**
- Auto-inference of nest/branch from content or project heuristics — that is Phase 34 SLIM-07
- Backfill of existing 64 memory rows to populate empty nest/branch — that is Phase 35
- Changes to memory_events table (audit log has no nest/branch columns, intentionally)
- Changes to updateEntry fallback semantics (would break patch-ignores-unspecified contract)
- Changes to nest_tree / graph_bridges SQL — those queries already work, they just had no data to query
- MCP end-to-end tests exercising the zod schemas (covered by existing test/mcp-tools.test.js schema-registration tests)
