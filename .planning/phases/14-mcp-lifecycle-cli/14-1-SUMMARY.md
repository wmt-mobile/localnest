  - "mcp config reads saved snippet from ~/.localnest/config/mcp.localnest.json when available, generates generic config otherwise"
  - "Added --client claude flag to output Claude Code specific instructions (claude mcp add command)"
  - "Added --raw flag to skip saved snippet and output a generic npx-based config"

# Phase 14 Plan 1: MCP Lifecycle CLI Summary

Replaced the Phase 14 stub in src/cli/commands/mcp.js with three working subcommands: start (launches MCP server in stdio mode via direct import), status (builds runtime config and reports server health, index backend, memory state, embedding provider), and config (outputs ready-to-paste JSON for AI client MCP configuration).

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Implement mcp start, status, and config subcommands

**mcp start** -- Resolves the mcp-server.js entry point relative to the CLI command file, dynamically imports it, and calls main(). The process stays alive as the MCP transport holds stdio open. Supports --json for structured output before handoff.

**mcp status** -- Calls buildRuntimeConfig() and buildLocalnestPaths() to gather all server settings. Reports: server name/version/mode, config file path and existence, snippet file status, index backend and DB existence, memory enabled/backend/DB, embedding provider/model/cache, and ripgrep availability. Supports --json for full structured output.

**mcp config** -- First checks for a saved snippet at ~/.localnest/config/mcp.localnest.json (created by setup). If found, outputs it directly. If not (or --raw is passed), generates a generic npx-based mcpServers JSON block. The --client claude flag outputs the `claude mcp add` command instead. Supports --json for all paths.
