# Phase 39: Tool Annotations (MCP Spec) Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** All 72 MCP tools have accurate `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint` annotations per MCP 2025-06-18 spec, AND a test validates the full mapping.

**Verified:** 2026-04-13
**Status:** human_needed (all automated checks pass; 3 client-UX items need a real MCP client to confirm)
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

| src/mcp/tools/retrieval.ts        | -    | File length 516 > 500         | INFO     | Pre-existing tech debt. Plan 01 actually shrank this file by 70 lines (586 -> 516). Logged in deferred-items.md. Not a Phase 39 regression. |

No TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders, or empty implementations introduced by Phase 39. The 2 inline `annotations: { ... }` blocks in core.ts are intentionally inline (documented exceptions for openWorldHint:true tools) and are explicitly covered by the validation test.

### Human Verification Required

Phase 39 is annotation metadata. Annotations are advisory hints consumed by MCP **clients** to render confirmation prompts, mark tools as safe/destructive, etc. The codebase ships them correctly (verified above), but only a real client renders the UX. The following 3 checks need a human to confirm with a real MCP client:

#### 1. Destructive warning on delete tools

**Test:** Connect a real MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) to localnest-mcp and invoke `localnest_kg_delete_entity` (or any of the 5 delete tools).

**Expected:** Client surfaces a confirmation/warning prompt because `destructiveHint: true`.

**Why human:** Each MCP client implements its own annotation-aware UX. Cannot be exercised by an automated test from inside the server.

#### 2. Read-only safety on search tools

**Test:** Same MCP client invokes `localnest_search_hybrid`.

**Expected:** Client treats the call as safe / does NOT prompt for confirmation because `readOnlyHint: true`. (This was specifically fixed in Plan 01 — pre-fix it was incorrectly marked as a write.)

**Why human:** Same — only a real client renders the safety treatment.

#### 3. Combined destructive + open-world on update_self

**Test:** Same MCP client invokes `localnest_update_self` (with dry_run: true to avoid actually upgrading).

**Expected:** Client surfaces both a destructive warning AND a network-call notice because `destructiveHint: true` AND `openWorldHint: true`. This is the only tool with both flags — verifying it confirms the inline-exception path works end-to-end.

**Why human:** This is the most subtle case — the inline annotation block exists precisely because the constant-based path can't represent both flags simultaneously.

### Gaps Summary

No automated gaps. All 8 must-have truths are verified, all 12 artifacts pass the 3-level (exists, substantive, wired) check plus data-flow trace, all key links are wired, and the validation test passes 163/163 in 9.6 s wall-clock. The full `npm test` was run end-to-end after re-reading all changed files.

The phase is automated-complete. The status is `human_needed` (not `passed`) only because annotations are client-facing metadata and the spec's promise — "clients render correct affordances" — can only be confirmed by exercising a real MCP client UI. The 3 human-verification items above are advisory; the engineering work for Phase 39 is fully delivered and locked against drift.

The single piece of pre-existing tech debt (`retrieval.ts` at 516 lines) is documented in `deferred-items.md` and is explicitly NOT a Phase 39 regression — Plan 01 reduced the file by 70 lines.
