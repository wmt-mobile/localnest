A local-first MCP server that gives AI agents safe access to your codebase, plus optional local memory and semantic indexing for high-quality retrieval.

Documentation: https://wmt-mobile.github.io/localnest/

Current beta package: `0.0.4-beta.5`

- [`guides/README.md`](./guides/README.md)
- [`guides/repository-structure.md`](./guides/repository-structure.md)
- [`guides/architecture.md`](./guides/architecture.md)
- [`guides/code-standards.md`](./guides/code-standards.md)

## What It Does

- **File discovery** — scoped, safe reads under configured roots
- **Lexical search** — fast ripgrep-backed pattern/symbol search
- **Semantic indexing** — `sqlite-vec` or JSON backend, fully local
- **Hybrid retrieval** — lexical + semantic fusion with RRF ranking
- **Project introspection** — roots, projects, tree, summaries
- **Local agent memory** — durable project knowledge, preferences, and recall, stored on your machine

All data stays on your machine. No external indexing service required.

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=18`
- `ripgrep` (`rg`) recommended for fastest lexical search (server still starts without it)

Install ripgrep:

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu/Debian | `sudo apt-get install ripgrep` |
| macOS | `brew install ripgrep` |
| Windows (winget) | `winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC` |
| Windows (choco) | `choco install ripgrep` |

## Installation

**Global install (recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g localnest-mcp
localnest setup
localnest doctor
```

**npx fallback** (if global install is unavailable):
```bash
npx -y localnest-mcp-setup
npx -y localnest-mcp-doctor
```

> Global install is preferred — it gives more deterministic dependency resolution and avoids transient npx cache issues.

Check the installed CLI version:

```bash
localnest version
```

Upgrade command:

```bash
localnest upgrade
localnest upgrade 0.0.4-beta.5
localnest upgrade install 0.0.4-beta.5
```

Model download readiness (recommended per user account):

```bash
localnest doctor --verbose
localnest setup
```

- Setup warms embedding/reranker models on first run (downloads into `~/.localnest/cache` by default).
- If `~/.localnest/cache` is not writable, LocalNest automatically falls back to a per-user temp cache path.
- Cache fallback is informational when startup still succeeds, but model files will not persist in the preferred cache location until the preferred path is writable again.
- If your environment is offline/restricted, skip warmup and run it later:

```bash
localnest setup --skip-model-download=true
```

- If default cache path is not writable, set a user-writable cache path before setup:

```bash
export LOCALNEST_EMBED_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/localnest-models"
export LOCALNEST_RERANKER_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/localnest-models"
localnest setup
```

## MCP Client Configuration

After running setup, LocalNest tries to detect supported AI tools on the current machine and writes or updates their LocalNest MCP entry automatically. It also saves `~/.localnest/config/mcp.localnest.json` for manual copy or clients you want to configure yourself:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "localnest": {
      "command": "localnest-mcp",
      "startup_timeout_sec": 30,
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "stdio",
        "LOCALNEST_CONFIG": "~/.localnest/config/localnest.config.json",
        "LOCALNEST_INDEX_BACKEND": "sqlite-vec",
        "LOCALNEST_DB_PATH": "~/.localnest/data/localnest.db",
        "LOCALNEST_INDEX_PATH": "~/.localnest/data/localnest.index.json",
        "LOCALNEST_MEMORY_ENABLED": "false",
        "LOCALNEST_MEMORY_BACKEND": "auto",
        "LOCALNEST_MEMORY_DB_PATH": "~/.localnest/data/localnest.memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Windows:** Setup writes the correct command for the host platform in `mcp.localnest.json` — use the generated file directly.

Restart your MCP client after updating the config.

If your client reports MCP startup timeout (for example 10s default), increase it:

```toml
[mcp_servers.localnest]
startup_timeout_sec = 30
```

### Supported Auto-Configured AI Tools

Setup currently auto-detects and updates these tools when their config directories are present:

- Codex
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Windsurf (Codeium-managed config)
- Gemini CLI / Antigravity
- Kiro

Setup writes a backup under `~/.localnest/backups/` before modifying a detected client config.

### Direct Binary vs `npx`

Prefer the direct binary when `localnest-mcp` is installed globally:

```json
{
  "command": "localnest-mcp"
}
```

Use `npx` only as a fallback when a global install is unavailable:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "localnest-mcp"]
}
```

If MCP startup fails before `initialize`, check whether:

- the client is still launching through `npx`
- npm cache permissions are broken for the current user
- `startup_timeout_sec` is too low for the current machine
- `localnest-mcp --version` works directly

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `localnest_usage_guide` | Best-practice guidance for agents — call this first when unsure |
| `localnest_server_status` | Runtime config, roots, ripgrep status, index backend |
| `localnest_task_context` | One-call runtime + memory context for a substantive task |
| `localnest_memory_status` | Memory consent, backend compatibility, database status |
| `localnest_memory_list` | List stored memories |
| `localnest_memory_get` | Fetch one memory with revision history |
| `localnest_memory_store` | Store a durable memory manually |
| `localnest_memory_update` | Update a memory and append a revision |
| `localnest_memory_delete` | Delete a memory |
| `localnest_memory_recall` | Recall relevant memories for a task/query |
| `localnest_capture_outcome` | One-call outcome capture into the memory event pipeline |
| `localnest_memory_capture_event` | Background event ingest that auto-promotes meaningful events into memory |
| `localnest_memory_events` | Inspect recently captured memory events |
| `localnest_update_status` | Check npm for latest LocalNest version (cached interval) |
| `localnest_update_self` | Update LocalNest globally and sync bundled skill (approval required) |
| `localnest_list_roots` | List configured roots |
| `localnest_list_projects` | List projects under a root |
| `localnest_project_tree` | File/folder tree for a project |
| `localnest_index_status` | Semantic index metadata (exists, stale, backend) |
| `localnest_index_project` | Build or refresh semantic index |
| `localnest_search_files` | File/path name search (best first step for module/feature discovery) |
| `localnest_search_code` | Lexical search (exact symbols, regex, identifiers) |
| `localnest_search_hybrid` | Hybrid search (lexical + semantic, RRF-ranked) |
| `localnest_get_symbol` | Find likely definition/export locations for a symbol |
| `localnest_find_usages` | Find import and call-site usages for a symbol |
| `localnest_read_file` | Read a bounded line window from a file |
| `localnest_summarize_project` | Language/extension breakdown for a project |

All tools support `response_format: "json"` (default) or `"markdown"`.
Only canonical `localnest_*` tool names are exposed (no short aliases) to keep MCP clients clean and non-duplicative.
Each MCP response also includes `meta.schema_version` so clients can detect contract revisions explicitly.

**List tools** return pagination fields: `total_count`, `count`, `limit`, `offset`, `has_more`, `next_offset`, `items`.

**Fast agent workflow (recommended default):**
```text
localnest_search_files (max_results: 20-30)
→ localnest_search_code (project_path + glob + max_results: 20-40 + context_lines: 2)
→ localnest_read_file (top 1-3 hits)
```

Use `localnest_search_hybrid` only when lexical search misses or you need concept-level retrieval. Keep `use_reranker=false` unless you need a final precision pass.

**Deep-task workflow (debug/refactor/review):**
```text
localnest_server_status → localnest_task_context → localnest_index_status
→ localnest_search_hybrid (optionally use_reranker=true)
→ localnest_read_file
→ localnest_capture_outcome
```

### Successful Execution vs Meaningful Evidence

A tool can execute successfully and still return weak evidence.

- Successful execution means the MCP call completed without transport or runtime failure.
- Meaningful evidence means the response contains useful matches, file lines, or actionable diagnostics for the current task.

Examples:

- `localnest_search_code` returning `[]` is a successful execution, but not meaningful evidence.
- `localnest_read_file` returning actual line content is meaningful evidence.
- `localnest_update_status` returning cached metadata is meaningful if it still tells the client whether an update is actionable.

For release checks and agent workflows, prefer responses that contain non-empty evidence over treating process success alone as sufficient.

## Index Backend

Choose during setup or via env var:

| Backend | When to use |
|---|---|
| `sqlite-vec` | Recommended. Persistent SQLite DB, efficient for large repos. Requires Node 22+. |
| `json` | Compatibility fallback for older Node runtimes. Auto-selected if sqlite-vec is unavailable. |

`localnest_index_status` and `localnest_server_status` now expose:
- `upgrade_recommended`
- `upgrade_reason`

When `backend=json` and `upgrade_recommended=true`, migrate to `sqlite-vec` for production-scale indexing.

## Configuration Reference

Setup writes two files:
- `~/.localnest/config/localnest.config.json` — roots and project settings
- `~/.localnest/config/mcp.localnest.json` — ready-to-paste MCP client config block
- `~/.localnest/data/` — sqlite/json index files and memory database
- `~/.localnest/cache/update-status.json` — cached npm update status
- `~/.localnest/backups/` — migration and config backups

This keeps the LocalNest home directory readable:
- `config/` for editable config and generated MCP snippets
- `data/` for SQLite/JSON runtime data
- `cache/` for refreshable metadata
- `backups/` for migration history

**Config priority:**
1. `PROJECT_ROOTS` environment variable
2. `LOCALNEST_CONFIG` file
3. Current working directory (fallback)

**Optional env vars:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LOCALNEST_INDEX_BACKEND` | `sqlite-vec` | `sqlite-vec` or `json` |
| `LOCALNEST_DB_PATH` | `~/.localnest/data/localnest.db` | SQLite database path |
| `LOCALNEST_INDEX_PATH` | `~/.localnest/data/localnest.index.json` | JSON index path |
| `LOCALNEST_SQLITE_VEC_EXTENSION` | — | Optional custom native extension path. If unset, no native extension load is attempted. |
| `LOCALNEST_VECTOR_CHUNK_LINES` | `60` | Lines per index chunk |
| `LOCALNEST_VECTOR_CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `15` | Overlap between chunks |
| `LOCALNEST_VECTOR_MAX_TERMS` | `80` | Max terms per chunk |
| `LOCALNEST_VECTOR_MAX_FILES` | `20000` | Max files per index run |
| `LOCALNEST_EMBED_PROVIDER` | `xenova` | Embedding backend |
| `LOCALNEST_EMBED_MODEL` | `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Embedding model |
| `LOCALNEST_EMBED_CACHE_DIR` | `~/.localnest/cache` | Embedding model cache path |
| `LOCALNEST_EMBED_DIMS` | `384` | Embedding vector dimensions |
| `LOCALNEST_RERANKER_PROVIDER` | `xenova` | Reranker backend |
| `LOCALNEST_RERANKER_MODEL` | `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | Cross-encoder reranker model |
| `LOCALNEST_RERANKER_CACHE_DIR` | `~/.localnest/cache` | Reranker model cache path |
| `LOCALNEST_MEMORY_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable local memory subsystem |
| `LOCALNEST_MEMORY_BACKEND` | `auto` | `auto`, `node-sqlite`, or `sqlite3` |
| `LOCALNEST_MEMORY_DB_PATH` | `~/.localnest/data/localnest.memory.db` | SQLite memory database path |
| `LOCALNEST_MEMORY_AUTO_CAPTURE` | `false` | Allow background event ingest to promote memories automatically |
| `LOCALNEST_MEMORY_CONSENT_DONE` | `false` | Indicates setup consent was already collected |
| `LOCALNEST_UPDATE_PACKAGE` | `localnest-mcp` | npm package name to check/update |
| `LOCALNEST_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | `120` | Refresh interval for npm update checks |
| `LOCALNEST_UPDATE_FAILURE_BACKOFF_MINUTES` | `15` | Retry interval when npm check fails |

Performance tips:
- Keep retrieval scoped with `project_path` and a narrow `glob` whenever possible.
- Keep `max_results` small first (20-40), then widen only when needed.
- Keep reranking off by default and enable it only for final answer quality on ambiguous queries.
- Avoid indexing all roots for one-off tasks; prefer project-scoped indexing.

## Installed Runtime Release Testing

Before publishing a new build, run the installed-runtime release harness against the globally installed binary:

```bash
node scripts/release-test-installed-runtime.mjs --version-label 0.0.4-beta.5
```

The harness writes both markdown and JSON reports under `reports/` and is intended to verify the installed runtime, not just the repo checkout.

## Local Memory

Memory is opt-in during `localnest setup`. When enabled, LocalNest stores durable project knowledge and preferences in a local SQLite database.

- Memory currently requires Node 22.13+ for built-in `node:sqlite`
- Node 18/20 continue to support the rest of LocalNest, but memory stays unavailable on those runtimes
- If memory backend initialization fails, existing code search and read tools still work

For agents, the intended flow is:

```text
localnest_task_context
→ work with code/search tools
→ localnest_capture_outcome
```

Use the lower-level `localnest_memory_status`, `localnest_memory_recall`, and `localnest_memory_capture_event` tools only when you need finer control than the bundled high-level flow.

`localnest_memory_capture_event` is still available for automatic/background use by AI tools. High-signal events such as bug fixes, decisions, reviews, and user preferences are promoted into durable memories; weak exploratory events are recorded and ignored.

## Auto-Migration

On startup, LocalNest auto-migrates older config schemas and the older flat `~/.localnest` home layout into `config/`, `data/`, `cache/`, and `backups/`. Non-destructive config backups are written under `~/.localnest/backups/`. No manual setup rerun is needed for normal upgrades.

If an older MCP client config still points `LOCALNEST_CONFIG` at `~/.localnest/localnest.config.json`, LocalNest falls forward to the new `~/.localnest/config/localnest.config.json` path automatically.

## Skill Distribution

LocalNest ships with a bundled AI agent skill (`localnest-mcp`) for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other supported clients.

Run after `npm install`:
```bash
localnest-mcp-install-skill
# Force reinstall:
localnest-mcp-install-skill --force
```

`localnest-mcp-install-skill` now checks the installed skill version first. If the target skill is already current, it reports that instead of replacing files unnecessarily. Use `--force` to resync anyway.

For deterministic shell hooks or client automation, LocalNest also ships:

```bash
localnest-mcp-task-context --task "debug auth refresh" --project-path /path/to/project
localnest-mcp-capture-outcome --task "fix auth refresh" --summary "Serialized refresh requests" --project-path /path/to/project --files-changed 2 --has-tests true
```

Both commands also accept JSON on stdin.
